## Introduction
This is a very basic command line RSA encryption and decrpytion tool built using Python. I was inspired to create this small project after reading *'The Mathematics of Secrets'* by Joshua Holden which is an interesting book about the history of ciphers and the potential future of cryptography.

I designed this to learn more about how the RSA algorithm works, and was written and used for education and experimental purposes only. The program has limitations with extremely large calculations.

## How to use
Run `RSA_tool.py` to use both the encrpytion and decryption tool in a single program. Then follow the menu isntructions to select an action.

## Technologies
- Python version 3.9.0
- Visual Studio Code version 1.79.2
